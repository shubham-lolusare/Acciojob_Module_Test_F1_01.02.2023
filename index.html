              Robert John Downey Jr. (born April 4, 1965) is an American actor
              and producer. His career has been characterized by critical and
              popular success in his youth, followed by a period of substance
              abuse and legal troubles, before a resurgence of commercial
              success later in his career. In 2008, Downey was named by Time
              magazine among the 100 most influential people in the world, and
              from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's
              highest-paid actor.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the age of five, he made his acting debut in his father Robert
              Downey Sr.'s film Pound in 1970. He subsequently worked with the
              Brat Pack in the teen films Weird Science (1985) and Less than
              Zero (1987). In 1992, Downey portrayed the title character in the
              biopic Chaplin, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award
              for Best Actor and won a BAFTA Award. Following a stint at the
              Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment Facility on drug charges, he
              joined the TV series Ally McBeal, for which he won a Golden Globe
              Award. He was fired from the show in the wake of drug charges in
              2000 and 2001. He stayed in a court-ordered drug treatment program
              and has maintained his sobriety since 2003.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially, completion bond companies would not insure Downey,
              until Mel Gibson paid the insurance bond for the 2003 film The
              Singing Detective. He went on to star in the black comedy Kiss
              Kiss Bang Bang (2005), the thriller Zodiac (2007), and the action
              comedy Tropic Thunder (2008); for the latter, he was nominated for
              an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Downey gained global recognition for starring as Tony Stark/Iron
              Man in ten films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning
              with Iron Man (2008), and leading up to Avengers: Endgame (2019).
              He has also played the title character in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock
              Holmes (2009), which earned him his second Golden Globe, and its
              sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011).

              Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 – 27 July
              2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served
              as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
              raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
              engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
              science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
              Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
              Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
              civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.
              He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work
              on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
              technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical,
              and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
              the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

              Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the
              support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
              then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as
              the "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of
              education, writing and public service after a single term. He was
              a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat
              Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

              While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management
              Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest
              on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level
              dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of
              Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.

              Narendra Damodardas Modi (born 17 September 1950) is an Indian
              politician serving as the 14th and current Prime Minister of India
              since 2014. Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to
              2014 and is the Member of Parliament from Varanasi. He is a member
              of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya
              Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist
              paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest serving
              prime minister from outside the Indian National Congress.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat,
              where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to
              the RSS at age eight. He has reminisced about helping out after
              school at his father's tea stall at the Vadnagar railway station.
              At age 18, Modi was married to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, whom he
              abandoned soon after. He first publicly acknowledged her as his
              wife more than four decades later when required to do so by Indian
              law, but has made no contact with her since. Modi has asserted he
              had travelled in northern India for two years after leaving his
              parental home, visiting a number of religious centres, but few
              details of his travels have emerged. Upon his return to Gujarat in
              1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. After the state of
              emergency was declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975,
              Modi went into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and
              he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001,
              rising to the rank of general secretary.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to
              Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following
              the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative
              assembly soon after. His administration has been considered
              complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots in which 1044 people were
              killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim, or otherwise
              criticised for its management of the crisis. A Special
              Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India found
              no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against Modi
              personally. While his policies as chief minister—credited with
              encouraging economic growth—have received praise, his
              administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve
              health, poverty and education indices in the state
            </p>
            <p>
              Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the party
              a majority in the lower house of Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha,
              the first time for any single party since 1984. Modi's
              administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the
              Indian economy and reduced spending on healthcare, education, and
              social welfare programmes. Modi centralised power by abolishing
              the Planning Commission and replacing it with the NITI Aayog. He
              began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially
              initiated a demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and a
              transformation of the taxation regime, and weakened or abolished
              environmental and labour laws. He oversaw the country's response
              to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Prime Minister, Modi has received
              consistently high approval ratings
            </p>
            <p>
              Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic
              backsliding.Following his party's victory in the 2019 general
              election, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu
              and Kashmir, introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act and three
              controversial farm laws, which prompted widespread protests and
              sit-ins across the country, resulting in a formal repeal of the
              latter. Described as engineering a political realignment towards
              right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy
              domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist
              beliefs and his handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as
              evidence of an exclusionary social agenda
